# Production Considerations & Security Implications

### Private Key Management

**What we should consider for a production app**

- Use dedicated HSM (AWS CloudHSM, Azure Key Vault, or physical HSM)
- Implement multi-signature wallets
- Consider MPC (Multi-Party Computation) for distributed key management (read about it from dynamic itself https://www.dynamic.xyz/blog/a-deep-dive-into-tss-mpc)

### Authentication & Authorization

**What we should consider for a production app**

- Implement 2FA/MFA for all wallet operations
- Add transaction signing confirmations
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- IP whitelisting for admin operations
- Audit logging for all sensitive operations

## Scalability Limitations

**What we should consider for a production app**

- Database sharding by user/wallet
- Read replicas for balance queries
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous blockchain operations

### Blockchain Integration

**What we should consider for a production app**

- Multiple RPC providers (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode)
- Load balancing across providers
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Batch RPC calls for efficiency

## Deployment Considerations

### Disaster Recovery

- Multi-region deployment
- Automated backups
